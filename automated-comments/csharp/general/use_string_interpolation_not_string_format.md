You are currently using `string.Format` to dynamically build a string. This is perfectly fine, but the more idiomatic C# solution to create such a string is to use [string interpolation](https://csharp.net-tutorials.com/operators/the-string-interpolation-operator/). Note that string interpolation is just a compiler trick, as under the hood any string interpolation expression is converted to a `string.Format` call. The benefit of using string interpolation is thus purely visual.
