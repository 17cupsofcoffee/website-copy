The code contains one or more `Console.WriteLine` or `Console.Write` statement, which can safely be removed as the tests don't require them to be added. You probably added these statement to debug your code. Usually, a better approach is to debug your code while running one or more unit tests. This has the added advantage that you can focus on debugging a specific test case. Here are some links that explain how to debug your code while running unit tests in various IDE's:
