## Coming as soon as possible

### Teams

We are building a dedicate site for teams. It will allow groups of people to complete exercises and mentor each other in a private space. We envision it being used by bootcamps, groups of friends, and colleagues at work. Teams on Exercism v1 was a really important feature for many people so restoring it is a top priority for us.

**Status:** Close to launching. Ironing out the last bugs.

### Merging the Javascript and ECMAScript tracks

We have decided to merge the Javascript and ECMAScript tracks. This will mean we can focus the work of the maintainers and mentors into one place, and improve the quality of our offering. 

**Status:** We have a good plan for this with a couple of issues to iron out. [Tracking issue](https://github.com/exercism/javascript/issues/556)
