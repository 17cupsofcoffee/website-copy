Mentors are free to choose whichever submissions they want to mentor. Normally, though, they work through either a track's queue (e.g. all the Ruby submissions), or an exercise's queue (e.g. all the Ruby High-Scores submissions). 

Queues are ordered algorithmically, but fundamentally acts likes a first-in-first-out queue with core exercises prioritised over side exercises, and those submitted in Mentored Mode priortised over those in Independent Mode.

Because there is no strict linear queue, and because mentors' rates of mentoring and mentoring behaviour changes daily, we currently do not provide time estimates. However, as a yardstick the quickest Tracks provide mentoring within a few hours, and the slowest within a few days.
